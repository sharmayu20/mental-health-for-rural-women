About 10% Indians suffer from stress, depression or substance use disorders. Few receive care for these problems, especially in rural areas. <br/> 
We want to address the issue of bringing mental healthcare into Rural MainStream, starting with Acceptability, Availability and Accessibility. <br/> 

We want to break the stigma around Mental Illness and Well being and to ensure that each individual privileged or under-privileged can ask for the right help
without any hesitation.
